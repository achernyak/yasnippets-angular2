# Angular 2 yasnippets

### Some basic Angular 2 yasnippets, converted from [John Papa's VSCode snippets](https://github.com/johnpapa/vscode-angular2-snippets)

## Installation:
- Get [yasnippet](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet), either from git or via ELPA.
- Clone this repo into wherever `yas-snippet-dir`  is pointing
- `M-x yas-reload-all` to refresh yasnippet and load the new snippets.

## Contributing/Issues
Feel free to fork/extend/correct/add to these snippets, they're basic and I just wanted a quick way to stamp out an ng2 Component definition in [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/).
